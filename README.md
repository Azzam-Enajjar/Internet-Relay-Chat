# Internet-Relay-Chat
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a Java application that allows people to chat with each other by exchanging text messages. The application is based on the client-server model consisting of a single chat server and multiple clients that connect over a TCP/IP enabled network. Clients can chat with each other by connecting to the IRC server that simply relays messages to the connected clients.
